Thee who seeks the deep

Summoner who called unto beast
From the waters underneath the East

Tales say wield Eons of whispers in the books
Passed to who coats themselves as friendly looks 

Thereby Leviathans sing encantations
A seeker communes pact with adoration

Come, who listens to the sound and be drowned
Live, who believes breathing are not surface bound
